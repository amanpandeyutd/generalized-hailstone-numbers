# generalized-hailstone-numbers
The program finds how many different holding
patterns the sequence converges to.

condition are 
1) xn = axn−1 +b if xn−1 is odd and 
2) xn = xn−1/2 if xn−1 is even 
3) where a and b are positive integers. 

For each of the a, b pairs less than or equal to 10, find
whether or not the sequence seems to converge.  

For example, 
when a = 3 and b = 5 then 1,8,4,2,1 this is holding pattern

However, if we start with a different number, say 5 we get a different holding pattern 5 ,20 , 10 , 5.
